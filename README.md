# astroph_suggestions

This is the source code for the astro ph [suggestions site](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~soslowski/astroph/) hosted at the [Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/), [Swinburne University of Technology](http://www.swinburne.edu.au/). This site is providing suggestions for papers to discuss at a journal club.

The server it's running on provides python 2.6 and thus a [modified version](https://github.com/sosl/ads) of the ads python interface is required.
